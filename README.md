Hi, this is a dashboard i made on a data that i found online for a bike company. I modified the data a bit.
The imaginary company for which the dashboard is created is called BAHA BIKES and it visualises the Sales report for FY 21-22.
I used SQL to extract the data and then transform it before loading it to visualise it.
I used Powerbi to create visualisation of data insights found by running SQL queries.
